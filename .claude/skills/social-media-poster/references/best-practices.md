## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This
- Using 10+ hashtags on Facebook/Twitter (reduces engagement)
- Posting same exact content to all platforms (not optimized)
- Using clickable links in Instagram captions (they don't work)
- Posting during low-engagement hours
- Using low-quality or wrong-sized images
- Forgetting call-to-action
- Ignoring first 125 characters on Instagram

### ✅ Do This Instead
- Use 1-2 hashtags on Facebook/Twitter, 20-30 on Instagram
- Adapt content for each platform (length, hashtags, format)
- Use "link in bio" for Instagram
- Post during optimal times (see above)
- Use platform-specific image dimensions
- Always include call-to-action
- Make first 125 characters compelling on Instagram

---

## Integration with MCP Servers

All three MCP servers support image uploading:

- `facebook_mcp.py`: create_post(image_path=...), upload_photo(image_path=...)
- `instagram_mcp.py`: create_media_post(image_path=...), create_story(image_path=...)
- `twitter_mcp.py`: create_tweet(media_paths=[...]), upload_media(media_path=...)

Claude Code will automatically use these tools when posting with images.

---

## Summary

This guide ensures Claude Code creates **optimized, engaging, platform-specific content** that follows industry best practices for maximum reach and engagement.

**Key Principles**:
1. Adapt content for each platform (don't copy-paste)
2. Use optimal hashtag counts (1-2 for FB/Twitter, 20-30 for Instagram)
3. Post at optimal times (see schedules above)
4. Include call-to-action for engagement
