## Analysis
SecureBank Financial requires an immediate security audit of their online banking platform following an industry-wide vulnerability disclosure. This is classified as HIGH priority due to "URGENT" and "CRITICAL" designations, security-sensitive nature, tight timeline (must begin January 16), and high-value client with regulatory requirements. The project has substantial budget ($75-90K) and requires immediate team mobilization.

## Recommended Actions
- [ ] Confirm team availability and capacity for January 16 start date
- [ ] Assemble security audit team: 1 lead auditor + 2 security specialists
- [ ] Review and sign NDA and security agreements with SecureBank
- [ ] Schedule kickoff call with Michael Chen and SecureBank's CISO within 24 hours
- [ ] Prepare comprehensive audit methodology document (penetration testing, API security, database review)
- [ ] Create tools and software checklist for security assessment
- [ ] Request access credentials, VPN access, and environment details from SecureBank
- [ ] Verify PCI-DSS and SOC 2 compliance requirements and checklists
- [ ] Set up secure communication channels and reporting infrastructure
- [ ] Draft preliminary project timeline with milestones (Jan 23 preliminary, Jan 30 final)

## Questions (if needed)
- What is the current security posture and any known vulnerabilities?
- Are there existing security audit reports we should review?
- What is the scope of third-party integrations that need review?
- Will we have access to production environment or staging only?
- Who are the technical contacts on SecureBank's security team?
- Are there any specific compliance frameworks beyond PCI-DSS and SOC 2?

## Done Condition
This plan is done when: Security audit team assembled, NDA signed, kickoff call completed, access credentials received, and audit methodology approved by SecureBank's CISO. Ready to begin security assessment on January 16, 2026.
