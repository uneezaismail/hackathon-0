## Analysis
FitLife Health & Wellness requires immediate support for their mobile fitness app launch scheduled for February 1, 2026. This is classified as HIGH priority due to "URGENT" designation, critical timeline (beta testing completion in 4 days), and significant financial impact if delayed. The project involves final sprint work across iOS/Android platforms, app store submissions, and launch coordination with marketing campaigns already scheduled.

## Recommended Actions
- [ ] Assemble mobile development team: 2 iOS developers + 2 Android developers + 1 QA specialist
- [ ] Schedule daily standup meetings at 9 AM for launch sprint (Jan 14 - Feb 1)
- [ ] Create comprehensive testing checklist covering all integration points (wearables, payment gateway, push notifications)
- [ ] Coordinate with Apple App Store and Google Play Store review teams for expedited review
- [ ] Complete final UI/UX polish and critical bug fixes by January 17
- [ ] Conduct integration testing with Apple Watch, Fitbit, and Garmin devices
- [ ] Optimize backend API performance and load testing for launch day traffic
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan and emergency response procedures
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards (Sentry, DataDog, or similar) for real-time app health tracking
- [ ] Brief customer support team on new features and create FAQ documentation
- [ ] Review and finalize privacy policy and terms of service with legal team
- [ ] Submit apps to both stores by January 22 deadline

## Questions (if needed)
- What is the current status of beta testing and known issues?
- Are there existing monitoring and analytics tools in place?
- Who is the technical lead on FitLife's side for coordination?
- What is the expected user load on launch day?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (HIPAA, health data regulations)?
- What is the rollback strategy if critical issues are discovered post-launch?

## Done Condition
This plan is done when: Mobile app successfully launched on both iOS and Android platforms on February 1, 2026, with all critical features tested, app store approvals received, monitoring systems active, and support team briefed. Beta testing completed by January 18, submissions completed by January 22.
