## Personal AI Employee Hackathon 0: Building

## Autonomous FTEs (Full-Time Equivalent) in 2026

**Tagline:** _Your life and business on autopilot. Local-first, agent-driven, human-in-the-loop._

This document serves as a comprehensive architectural blueprint and hackathon guide for
building a "Digital FTE" (Full-Time Equivalent). It proposes a futuristic, local-first approach to
automation where an AI agent—powered by Claude Code and Obsidian—proactively manages
personal and business affairs 24/7. You can also think of it as a "Smart Consultant" (General
Agents). The focus is on high-level reasoning, autonomy, and flexibility. Think of it as hiring a
senior employee who figures out how to solve the problems.

This hackathon takes the concept of a "Personal AI Employee" to its logical extreme. It doesn't
just wait for you to type; it proactively manages your "Personal Affairs" (Gmail, WhatsApp,
Bank) and your "Business" (Social Media, Payments, Project Tasks) using **Claude Code** as the
executor and **Obsidian** as the management dashboard.

All our faculty members and students will build this Personal AI Employee using Claude Code.

**Standout Idea:** The "Monday Morning CEO Briefing," where the AI autonomously audits bank
transactions and tasks to report revenue and bottlenecks, transforms the AI from a chatbot
into a proactive business partner.

**Architecture & Tech Stack:**

The proposed stack is robust, privacy-focused, and clever:

```
● The Brain: Claude Code acts as the reasoning engine.
● The Memory/GUI: Obsidian (local Markdown) is used as the dashboard, keeping data
local and accessible.
● The Senses (Watchers): Lightweight Python scripts monitor Gmail, WhatsApp, and
filesystems to trigger the AI.
● The Hands (MCP): Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers handle external actions like
sending emails or clicking buttons.
```
This architecture solves the "lazy agent" problem by using "Watchers" to wake the agent up
rather than waiting for user input.

This is an exceptional technical hackathon project. It moves beyond "prompt engineering" into
"agent engineering." It provides a complete, viable path to building a functional autonomous
agent using tools available in 2026 (or today).


**Research and Show Case Meeting Every Wednesday:**
We will be holding a Research Meeting every Wednesday at 10:00 pm on Zoom all of you are
welcome to join, the first meeting will be held on Wednesday, Jan 7th, 2026:

In these meetings we will be teaching each other how to build and enhance our first AI
Employee.

##### Digital FTE: The New Unit of Value

A Digital FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) is an AI agent that is built, "hired," and priced as if it were a
human employee. This shifts the conversation from "software licenses" to "headcount budgets."

##### Human FTE vs Digital FTE

###### Feature Human FTE Digital FTE (Custom Agent)

###### Availability 40 hours / week 168 hours / week (24/7)

###### Monthly Cost $4,000 – $8,000+ $500 – $2,

###### Ramp-up Time 3 – 6 Months Instant (via SKILL.md)

###### Consistency Variable (85–95% accuracy) Predictable (99%+ consistency)

###### Scaling Linear (Hire 10 for 10x work) Exponential (Instant duplication)

###### Cost per Task ~$3.00 – $6.00 ~$0.25 – $0.

###### Annual Hours ~2,000 hours ~8,760 hours

###### The 'Aha!' Moment: A Digital FTE works nearly 9,000 hours a year vs a human's

###### 2,000. The cost per task reduction (from ~$5.00 to ~$0.50) is an 85–90% cost

###### saving—usually the threshold where a CEO approves a project without further

###### debate.

#### 1. The "Foundational Layer" (Local Engine)

```
● The Nerve Center (Obsidian): Acts as the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and
Long-Term Memory.
○ Dashboard.md: Real-time summary of bank balance, pending messages, and active
business projects.
○ Company_Handbook.md: Contains your "Rules of Engagement" (e.g., "Always be
polite on WhatsApp," "Flag any payment over $500 for my approval").
● The Muscle (Claude Code): Runs in your terminal, pointed at your Obsidian vault. It uses
its File System tools to read your tasks and write reports.
```
#### 2. Architecture: Perception → Reasoning → Action

###### A. Perception (The "Watchers")

Since Claude Code can't "listen" to the internet 24/7, you use lightweight **Python Sentinel
Scripts** running in the background:

```
● Comms Watcher: Monitors Gmail and WhatsApp (via local web-automation or APIs) and
saves new urgent messages as .md files in a /Needs_Action folder.
● Finance Watcher: Downloads local CSVs or calls banking APIs to log new transactions in
/Accounting/Current_Month.md.
● It will also be able to run on your laptop and immediately “wake up” as soon as you open
your machine.
```
##### Watcher Architecture

The Watcher layer is your AI Employee's sensory system. These lightweight Python scripts run
continuously, monitoring various inputs and creating actionable files for Claude to process.

##### Core Watcher Pattern

All Watchers follow this structure:

# base_watcher.py - Template for all watchers
import time
import logging
from pathlib import Path
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseWatcher(ABC):
def __init__(self, vault_path: str, check_interval: int = 60):
self.vault_path = Path(vault_path)
self.needs_action = self.vault_path / 'Needs_Action'
self.check_interval = check_interval
self.logger = logging.getLogger(self.__class__.__name__)


@abstractmethod
def check_for_updates(self) -> list:
'''Return list of new items to process'''
pass

@abstractmethod
def create_action_file(self, item) -> Path:
'''Create .md file in Needs_Action folder'''
pass

def run(self):
self.logger.info(f'Starting {self.__class__.__name__}')
while True:
try:
items = self.check_for_updates()
for item in items:
self.create_action_file(item)
except Exception as e:
self.logger.error(f'Error: {e}')
time.sleep(self.check_interval)

##### Gmail Watcher Implementation

# gmail_watcher.py
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from base_watcher import BaseWatcher
from datetime import datetime

class GmailWatcher(BaseWatcher):
def __init__(self, vault_path: str, credentials_path: str):
super().__init__(vault_path, check_interval=120)
self.creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file(credentials_path)
self.service = build('gmail', 'v1', credentials=self.creds)
self.processed_ids = set()

def check_for_updates(self) -> list:
results = self.service.users().messages().list(
userId='me', q='is:unread is:important'
).execute()
messages = results.get('messages', [])
return [m for m in messages if m['id'] not in self.processed_ids]

def create_action_file(self, message) -> Path:
msg = self.service.users().messages().get(
userId='me', id=message['id']
).execute()


# Extract headers
headers = {h['name']: h['value'] for h in msg['payload']['headers']}

content = f'''---
type: email
from: {headers.get('From', 'Unknown')}
subject: {headers.get('Subject', 'No Subject')}
received: {datetime.now().isoformat()}
priority: high
status: pending
---

## Email Content
{msg.get('snippet', '')}

## Suggested Actions

- [ ] Reply to sender
- [ ] Forward to relevant party
- [ ] Archive after processing
'''
filepath = self.needs_action / f'EMAIL_{message["id"]}.md'
filepath.write_text(content)
self.processed_ids.add(message['id'])
return filepath

##### WhatsApp Watcher (Playwright-based)

Note: This uses WhatsApp Web automation. Be aware of WhatsApp's terms of service.

# whatsapp_watcher.py
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from base_watcher import BaseWatcher
from pathlib import Path
import json

class WhatsAppWatcher(BaseWatcher):
def __init__(self, vault_path: str, session_path: str):
super().__init__(vault_path, check_interval=30)
self.session_path = Path(session_path)
self.keywords = ['urgent', 'asap', 'invoice', 'payment', 'help']

def check_for_updates(self) -> list:
with sync_playwright() as p:
browser = p.chromium.launch_persistent_context(
self.session_path, headless=True
)
page = browser.pages[0]
page.goto('https://web.whatsapp.com')


page.wait_for_selector('[data-testid="chat-list"]')

# Find unread messages
unread = page.query_selector_all('[aria-label*="unread"]')
messages = []
for chat in unread:
text = chat.inner_text().lower()
if any(kw in text for kw in self.keywords):
messages.append({'text': text, 'chat': chat})
browser.close()
return messages

##### File System Watcher (for local drops)

# filesystem_watcher.py
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler
from pathlib import Path
import shutil

class DropFolderHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
def __init__(self, vault_path: str):
self.needs_action = Path(vault_path) / 'Needs_Action'

def on_created(self, event):
if event.is_directory:
return
source = Path(event.src_path)
dest = self.needs_action / f'FILE_{source.name}'
shutil.copy2(source, dest)
self.create_metadata(source, dest)

def create_metadata(self, source: Path, dest: Path):
meta_path = dest.with_suffix('.md')
meta_path.write_text(f'''---
type: file_drop
original_name: {source.name}
size: {source.stat().st_size}
---

New file dropped for processing.
''')

###### B. Reasoning (Claude Code)

When the **Watcher** detects a change, it triggers a Claude command:


6. **Read:** "Check /Needs_Action and /Accounting."
7. **Think:** "I see a WhatsApp message from a client asking for an invoice and a bank
    transaction showing a late payment fee."
8. **Plan:** Claude creates a Plan.md in Obsidian with checkboxes for the next steps.

### C. Action (The "Hands")

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are Claude Code's hands for interacting with external
systems. Each MCP server exposes specific capabilities that Claude can invoke.

Claude uses custom **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** servers to act:

```
● WhatsApp/Social MCP: To send the reply or post the scheduled update.
● Browser/Payment MCP: To log into a payment portal, draft a payment, and stop.
● Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): Claude writes a file:
APPROVAL_REQUIRED_Payment_Client_A.md. It will not click "Send" until you move that
file to the /Approved folder.
```
##### Recommended MCP Servers

```
Server Capabilities Use Case
```
```
filesystem Read, write, list files Built-in, use for vault
```
```
email-mcp Send, draft, search emails Gmail integration
```
```
browser-mcp Navigate, click, fill forms Payment portals
calendar-mcp Create, update events Scheduling
```
```
slack-mcp Send messages, read channels Team communication
```
##### Claude Code Configuration

Configure MCP servers in your Claude Code settings:

// ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json
{
"servers": [
{
"name": "email",
"command": "node",
"args": ["/path/to/email-mcp/index.js"],
"env": {
"GMAIL_CREDENTIALS": "/path/to/credentials.json"
}
},
{
"name": "browser",


"command": "npx",
"args": ["@anthropic/browser-mcp"],
"env": {
"HEADLESS": "true"
}
}
]
}

##### Human-in-the-Loop Pattern

For sensitive actions, Claude writes an approval request file instead of acting directly:

# When Claude detects a sensitive action needed:
# 1. Create approval request file

# /Vault/Pending_Approval/PAYMENT_Client_A_2026-01-07.md
---
type: approval_request
action: payment
amount: 500.
recipient: Client A
reason: Invoice #1234 payment
created: 2026-01-07T10:30:00Z
expires: 2026-01-08T10:30:00Z
status: pending
---

## Payment Details

- Amount: $500.
- To: Client A (Bank: XXXX1234)
- Reference: Invoice #

## To Approve
Move this file to /Approved folder.

## To Reject
Move this file to /Rejected folder.

The Orchestrator watches the /Approved folder and triggers the actual MCP action when files
appear.

#### 3. Continuous vs. Scheduled Operations

```
Operation Type Example Task Local Trigger
```

```
Scheduled Daily Briefing: Summarize
business tasks at 8:00 AM.
```
```
cron (Mac/Linux) or Task
Scheduler (Win) calls
Claude.
```
```
Continuous Lead Capture: Watch
WhatsApp for keywords like
"Pricing."
```
```
Python watchdog script
monitoring the /Inbox
folder.
```
```
Project-Based Q1 Tax Prep: Categorize 3
months of business
expenses.
```
```
Manual drag-and-drop of a
file into the /Active_Project
folder.
```
#### 4. Key Hackathon Feature: The "Business Handover"

One of the coolest features you can add is the **Autonomous Business Audit** :

1. **The Trigger:** A scheduled task runs every Sunday night.
2. **The Process:** Claude Code reads your Business_Goals.md, checks your Tasks/Done
    folder for the week, and checks your Bank_Transactions.md.
3. **The Deliverable:** It writes a "Monday Morning CEO Briefing" in Obsidian, highlighting:
    ○ **Revenue:** Total earned this week.
    ○ **Bottlenecks:** Tasks that took too long.
    ○ **Proactive Suggestion:** "I noticed we spent $200 on software we don't use; shall I
       cancel the subscription?"

##### Business Handover Templates

The Business Handover feature transforms your AI Employee from reactive to proactive. Here
are the required templates with explicit schemas.

##### Business_Goals.md Template

# /Vault/Business_Goals.md

## Q1 2026 Objectives

### Revenue Target

- Monthly goal: $10,
- Current MTD: $4,


### Key Metrics to Track
| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Client response time | < 24 hours | > 48 hours |
| Invoice payment rate | > 90% | < 80% |
| Software costs | < $500/month | > $600/month |

### Active Projects

1. Project Alpha - Due Jan 15 - Budget $2,
2. Project Beta - Due Jan 30 - Budget $3,

### Subscription Audit Rules
Flag for review if:

- No login in 30 days
- Cost increased > 20%
- Duplicate functionality with another tool

##### Weekly Audit Logic

Claude uses pattern matching to identify subscription usage:

# audit_logic.py
SUBSCRIPTION_PATTERNS = {
'netflix.com': 'Netflix',
'spotify.com': 'Spotify',
'adobe.com': 'Adobe Creative Cloud',
'notion.so': 'Notion',
'slack.com': 'Slack',
# Add your common subscriptions
}

def analyze_transaction(transaction):
for pattern, name in SUBSCRIPTION_PATTERNS.items():
if pattern in transaction['description'].lower():
return {
'type': 'subscription',
'name': name,
'amount': transaction['amount'],
'date': transaction['date']
}
return None

#### 5. Tech Stack Summary

```
● Knowledge Base: Obsidian (Local Markdown).
● Logic Engine: Claude Code (running claude-3-5-sonnet or any other LLM using Claude
Code Router).
● External Integration: MCP Servers (Local Node.js/Python scripts) for Gmail, WhatsApp,
and Banking.
○ Playwright for "Computer Use" (interacting with websites for payments).
● Automation Glue: A master Python Orchestrator.py that handles the timing and folder
watching.
```

### 6. Security & Privacy Architecture

Security is non-negotiable when building an autonomous system that handles banking, email,
and personal communications. This section outlines required security measures.

##### 6.1 Credential Management

Never store credentials in plain text or in your Obsidian vault.

```
● Use environment variables for API keys: export GMAIL_API_KEY="your-key"
● For banking credentials, use a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., macOS Keychain,
Windows Credential Manager, or 1Password CLI)
● Create a .env file (add to .gitignore immediately) for local development
● Rotate credentials monthly and after any suspected breach
```
Example .env structure:

# .env - NEVER commit this file
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
BANK_API_TOKEN=your_token
WHATSAPP_SESSION_PATH=/secure/path/session

##### 6.2 Sandboxing & Isolation

Protect against unintended actions during development:

```
● Development Mode: Create a DEV_MODE flag that prevents any real external actions
● Dry Run: All action scripts should support a --dry-run flag that logs intended actions
without executing
● Separate Accounts: Use test/sandbox accounts for Gmail and banking during
development
● Rate Limiting: Implement maximum actions per hour (e.g., max 10 emails, max 3
payments)
```
Example dry-run implementation:

# In any action script
DRY_RUN = os.getenv('DRY_RUN', 'true').lower() == 'true'

def send_email(to, subject, body):
if DRY_RUN:
logger.info(f'[DRY RUN] Would send email to {to}')
return
# Actual send logic here


##### 6.3 Audit Logging

Every action the AI takes must be logged for review:

# Required log format
{
"timestamp": "2026-01-07T10:30:00Z",
"action_type": "email_send",
"actor": "claude_code",
"target": "client@example.com",
"parameters": {"subject": "Invoice #123"},
"approval_status": "approved",
"approved_by": "human",
"result": "success"
}

Store logs in /Vault/Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json and retain for a minimum 90 days.

##### 6.4 Permission Boundaries

```
Action Category Auto-Approve Threshold Always Require Approval
```
```
Email replies To known contacts New contacts, bulk sends
```
```
Payments < $50 recurring All new payees, > $
Social media Scheduled posts Replies, DMs
```
```
File operations Create, read Delete, move outside vault
```
### 7. Error States & Recovery

Autonomous systems will fail. Plan for it. This section covers common failure modes and
recovery strategies.

##### 7.1 Error Categories

```
Category Examples Recovery Strategy
```
```
Transient Network timeout, API rate limit Exponential backoff retry
```
```
Authentication Expired token, revoked access Alert human, pause operations
```
```
Logic Claude misinterprets message Human review queue
Data Corrupted file, missing field Quarantine + alert
```
```
System Orchestrator crash, disk full Watchdog + auto-restart
```

##### 7.2 Retry Logic

# retry_handler.py
import time
from functools import wraps

def with_retry(max_attempts=3, base_delay=1, max_delay=60):
def decorator(func):
@wraps(func)
def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
for attempt in range(max_attempts):
try:
return func(*args, **kwargs)
except TransientError as e:
if attempt == max_attempts - 1:
raise
delay = min(base_delay * (2 ** attempt), max_delay)
logger.warning(f'Attempt {attempt+1} failed, retrying in
{delay}s')
time.sleep(delay)
return wrapper
return decorator

##### 7.3 Graceful Degradation

When components fail, the system should degrade gracefully:

- Gmail API down: Queue outgoing emails locally, process when restored
- Banking API timeout: Never retry payments automatically, always require fresh approval
- Claude Code unavailable: Watchers continue collecting, queue grows for later
    processing
- Obsidian vault locked: Write to temporary folder, sync when available

##### 7.4 Watchdog Process

# watchdog.py - Monitor and restart critical processes
import subprocess
import time
from pathlib import Path

PROCESSES = {
'orchestrator': 'python orchestrator.py',
'gmail_watcher': 'python gmail_watcher.py',
'file_watcher': 'python filesystem_watcher.py'
}

def check_and_restart():
for name, cmd in PROCESSES.items():


pid_file = Path(f'/tmp/{name}.pid')
if not is_process_running(pid_file):
logger.warning(f'{name} not running, restarting...')
proc = subprocess.Popen(cmd.split())
pid_file.write_text(str(proc.pid))
notify_human(f'{name} was restarted')

while True:
check_and_restart()
time.sleep(60)

### Example: End-to-End Invoice Flow

This walkthrough demonstrates a complete flow from trigger to action, showing how all
components work together.

##### Scenario

A client sends a WhatsApp message asking for an invoice. The AI Employee should: (1) detect
the request, (2) generate the invoice, (3) send it via email, and (4) log the transaction.

##### Step 1: Detection (WhatsApp Watcher)

The WhatsApp Watcher detects a message containing the keyword "invoice":


# Detected message:
# From: Client A
# Text: "Hey, can you send me the invoice for January?"

# Watcher creates:
# /Vault/Needs_Action/WHATSAPP_client_a_2026-01-07.md

##### Step 2: Reasoning (Claude Code)

The Orchestrator triggers Claude to process the Needs_Action folder:

# Claude reads the file and creates:
# /Vault/Plans/PLAN_invoice_client_a.md

---
created: 2026-01-07T10:30:00Z
status: pending_approval
---

## Objective
Generate and send January invoice to Client A

## Steps

- [x] Identify client: Client A (client_a@email.com)
- [x] Calculate amount: $1,500 (from /Accounting/Rates.md)
- [ ] Generate invoice PDF
- [ ] Send via email (REQUIRES APPROVAL)
- [ ] Log transaction

## Approval Required
Email send requires human approval. See /Pending_Approval/

##### Step 3: Approval (Human-in-the-Loop)

Claude creates an approval request:

# /Vault/Pending_Approval/EMAIL_invoice_client_a.md
---
action: send_email
to: client_a@email.com
subject: January 2026 Invoice - $1,
attachment: /Vault/Invoices/2026-01_Client_A.pdf
---

Ready to send. Move to /Approved to proceed.

You review and move the file to /Approved.

##### Step 4: Action (Email MCP)


The Orchestrator detects the approved file and calls the Email MCP:

# MCP call (simplified)
await email_mcp.send_email({
to: 'client_a@email.com',
subject: 'January 2026 Invoice - $1,500',
body: 'Please find attached your invoice for January 2026.',
attachment: '/Vault/Invoices/2026-01_Client_A.pdf'
});

# Result logged to /Vault/Logs/2026-01-07.json

##### Step 5: Completion

Claude updates the Dashboard and moves files to Done:

# /Vault/Dashboard.md updated:
## Recent Activity

- [2026-01-07 10:45] Invoice sent to Client A ($1,500)

# Files moved:
# /Needs_Action/WHATSAPP_... -> /Done/
# /Plans/PLAN_invoice_... -> /Done/
# /Approved/EMAIL_... -> /Done/

### Troubleshooting FAQ

##### Setup Issues

**Q: Claude Code says "command not found"**

A: Ensure Claude Code is installed globally and your PATH is configured. Run: npm install -g
@anthropic/claude-code, then restart your terminal.

**Q: Obsidian vault isn't being read by Claude**

A: Check that you're running Claude Code from the vault directory, or using the --cwd flag to
point to it. Verify file permissions allow read access.

**Q: Gmail API returns 403 Forbidden**

A: Your OAuth consent screen may need verification, or you haven't enabled the Gmail API in
Google Cloud Console. Check the project settings.

##### Runtime Issues

**Q: Watcher scripts stop running overnight**


A: Use a process manager like PM2 (Node.js) or supervisord (Python) to keep them alive.
Alternatively, implement the Watchdog pattern from Section 7.

**Q: Claude is making incorrect decisions**

A: Review your Company_Handbook.md rules. Add more specific examples. Consider lowering
autonomy thresholds so more actions require approval.

**Q: MCP server won't connect**

A: Check that the server process is running (ps aux | grep mcp). Verify the path in mcp.json is
absolute. Check Claude Code logs for connection errors.

##### Security Concerns

**Q: How do I know my credentials are safe?**

A: Never commit .env files. Use environment variables. Regularly rotate credentials. Implement
the audit logging from Section 6 to track all access.

**Q: What if Claude tries to pay the wrong person?**

A: That's why HITL is critical for payments. Any payment action should create an approval file
first. Never auto-approve payments to new recipients.


### Ethics & Responsible Automation

With great automation comes great responsibility. Consider these principles as you build.

##### When Should AI NOT Act Autonomously?

```
● Emotional contexts: Condolence messages, conflict resolution, sensitive negotiations
● Legal matters: Contract signing, legal advice, regulatory filings
● Medical decisions: Health-related actions affecting you or others
● Financial edge cases: Unusual transactions, new recipients, large amounts
● Irreversible actions: Anything that cannot be easily undone
```
##### Transparency Principles

```
● Disclose AI involvement: When your AI sends emails, consider adding a signature noting
AI assistance
● Maintain audit trails: All actions should be logged and reviewable
● Allow opt-out: Give contacts a way to request human-only communication
● Regular reviews: Schedule weekly reviews of AI decisions to catch drift
```
##### Privacy Considerations

9. Minimize data collection: Only capture what's necessary
10. Local-first: Keep sensitive data on your machine when possible
11. Encryption at rest: Consider encrypting your Obsidian vault
12. Third-party caution: Understand what data leaves your system via APIs

##### The Human Remains Accountable

Remember: You are responsible for your AI Employee's actions. The automation runs on your
behalf, using your credentials, acting in your name. Regular oversight isn't optional—it's
essential.

Suggested oversight schedule:

1. Daily: 2-minute dashboard check
2. Weekly: 15-minute action log review
3. Monthly: 1-hour comprehensive audit
4. Quarterly: Full security and access review

**Core Strengths:**

**Local-First:** Privacy-centric architecture using Obsidian.

**HITL Safety:** Sophisticated file-based approval system prevents AI accidents.


#### Note for Developers: Why "Watchers" Need Process Management

In the proposed architecture, your "Watchers" (Gmail, WhatsApp listeners) are essentially

**daemon processes**. They are designed to run indefinitely to poll for events^1.

However, standard Python scripts invoked via terminal (e.g., python watcher.py) are fragile:

```
● They terminate if the TTY/SSH session closes.
● They crash on unhandled exceptions (e.g., transient API timeouts).
● They do not auto-recover after a system reboot.
```
**"Process Management"** solves this by wrapping your scripts in a supervisor that ensures
state persistence.

###### The Problem: Script Fragility

If you run python gmail_watcher.py and your internet blips for 5 seconds, the script throws an
exception and exits. Your AI employee is now "dead" until you manually SSH in and restart it.

###### The Solution: A Process Manager (PM)

A PM (like **PM2** , **supervisord** , or **Systemd** ) acts as a watchdog. It daemonizes your script and
monitors its PID.

```
● Auto-Restart: If the process exits with a non-zero code (crash), the PM immediately
restarts it^2.
```
```
● Startup Persistence: It hooks into the OS init system (e.g., systemd on Linux) to launch
the script on boot^3.
```
```
● Logging: It captures stdout/stderr to log files, which is critical for debugging silent
failures over long periods.
```
Quick Recommendation:
For this hackathon, PM2 is often the easiest developer-friendly tool (originally for Node, but
handles Python perfectly):

# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start your watcher and keep it alive forever
pm2 start gmail_watcher.py --interpreter python3

# Freeze this list to start on reboot
pm2 save


pm2 startup

Alternatively, the hackathon document suggests writing a custom Python "Watchdog" script
that loops and checks PIDs, effectively building a primitive process manager yourself.

#### Next Step: Advanced Custom Cloud FTE Architecture

Once you have built this local AI Employee, you can shift to building cloud based custom FTEs:
